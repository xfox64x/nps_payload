The above licensing was taken from the BSD licensing and is applied to NPS_Payload as well.

Feel free to modify, use, change, market, do whatever you want with it as long as you give the appropriate credit where credit
is due (which means giving the authors the credit they deserve for writing it). Also note that, by using this software, if you ever
see the creator of NPS_Payload in a bar, you should buy them a beer. No hugs, as this is 2018. Author holds the right to refuse the beer.

At this point, I think I've made enough changes to where this is no longer the property of TrustedSec, LLC (and it probably never really was given the dependence on numerous others' work and open-source content), but I'll leave this here anyways. To be clear, I'm not claiming any sort of ownership over the ideas presented, just owning the changes I've made. I'll buy you that beer.
